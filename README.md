###Test automation on Magento web application


## Project created by Raluca Sferle

Description: 
Within the project, the automatic testing of a web application was performed with the help of automatic tests. So the theme of the project is to check the operation of a web application correctly, reporting errors that occur through a report created by the Maven plugin.
The project aims to create several tests, grouped into several categories, focusing especially on the main category, this being the actions performed in the store.

The main technology used for automatic testing of the Magento web application is the Selenide framework, as it is a powerful tool that contains selectors, simple installation configuration and uses Ajax for stable tests. The application created for the test was written in Java on the IntelIJ Community desktop. To create reports within the Selenide application, the Maven plugin was installed through its dependencies.

Keywords: Selenide, Java, IntelIJ Community, Maven dependency
