policy action and is innovative in terms of responses across all levels and sectors of government and society,<br>
emphasizing developing assets and resilience within communities, empowerment and creating supportive<br>
environments. It details the strengthened roles of public health services and the health system. Health 2020<br>
was approved in two forms: a European policy framework supporting action across government and society for<br>
health and well-being for politicians and those developing policy and the longer Health 2020 policy framework<br>
and strategy, which provides more operational detail. Implementing Health 2020 in countries is now the<br>
fundamental top-priority challenge for the Region.<br>

Introduction<br>
Health 2020 is a value- and evidence-based health policy framework for health<br>
and well-being among the people of the WHO European Region. The hope<br>
is that Health 2020 will provide understanding and inspiration to everyone<br>
across the European Region who wishes to seize new opportunities to improve<br>
the health and well-being of present and future generations, by showing both<br>
the challenges, opportunities and ways forward. Health 2020 is for everyone:<br>
not just politicians and experts but also civil society, communities, families<br>
and individuals.<br>
Why is Health 2020 important? Health 2020 presents the social and economic<br>
imperative for action, showing clearly that health and well-being are important<br>
and essential for economic and social development. It focuses on health as<br>
a human right; whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches to<br>
equitable improvement in health; strong and invigorated governance and<br>
leadership for health; collaborative models of working and shared priorities<br>
with other sectors; the importance of community and individual reliance and<br>
empowerment; and the role of partnerships.<br>
The WHO Regional Committee for Europe approved Health 2020 in 2012 in<br>
two documentary forms, included here in a single publication. The European<br>
policy framework for supporting government and society for health and wellbeing provides politicians and policy practitioners with the main values and<br>
principles needed to put Health 2020 into practice. It focuses on today’s major<br>
health challenges as well as the opportunities for equitable improvement in<br>
health and provides strong political, social and economic arguments for health<br>
action, built around the policy framework’s key strategic policy objectives and<br>
priorities.<br>
The longer Health 2020 policy framework and strategy provides in much greater<br>
detail the contextual analysis and the main strategies and interventions that<br>
work as well as the necessary evidence and details of the capacity required<br>
for implementing the policies and practices designed to improve health and<br>
well-being. The emphasis is on innovative and evidence-informed policy and<br>
practice, presented to assist those who develop and implement operational<br>
policy. The Health 2020 policy framework and strategy is seen as a living guide,<br>
providing links to later changes in evidence, practice and outcomes.<br>
Taken together, these publications provide a flexible framework for policy and<br>
practice across the Member States of the European Region, building on a long<br>
history of global and regional policy thinking. Health 2020 is fully aligned with<br>
the WHO reform process and will be actively promoted by the WHO Regional<br>
Office for Europe among its Member States, who should receive integrated<br>
in-country support in the context of their individual needs and priorities. Here<br>
WHO must work in partnership, and everyone involved in developing Health<br>
2020 must be willing to advocate for it and be committed to make it work.<br>

Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
Foreword<br>
Health 2020: a European policy framework supporting action across government<br>
and society for health and well-being sets out a far-sighted and ambitious<br>
agenda for health. Agreement on this framework by all 53 Member States of<br>
the WHO European Region comes at a crucial time. As we approach 2015 and<br>
the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, this policy will<br>
help to position health in the next generation of global goals.<br>
The framework crystallizes what we have learned about the role of health in<br>
recent years. Maximizing health through all stages of life is a fundamental right<br>
for all and not a privilege for a few. Good health is an asset and a source of<br>
economic and social stability. It is key to reducing poverty and both contributes<br>
to and benefits from sustainable development. Most important, good health<br>
can no longer be seen an outcome of one sector alone: sustainable and<br>
equitable improvements in health are the product of effective policy across all<br>
parts of government and collaborative efforts across all parts of society.<br>
Readers will find that these insights lie at the heart of the strategy. The<br>
challenges to be addressed in the Region are considerable. Health inequities<br>
within and between countries reflect economic and social divisions across<br>
society. As economic pressures bite and health care costs rise, the risk of<br>
exclusion increases, too often leaving behind those with the greatest health<br>
needs. At the same time, we know that public expectations for the newest and<br>
the best in health technology in combination with the changing disease profile<br>
of ageing populations place huge pressure on budgets. New approaches and<br>
perspectives are needed if universal health coverage is to be a reality for<br>
the countries of the Region. Shifting the mindset of policy-makers, health<br>
providers and members of the public from one that sees health in terms of<br>
combating illness to one mainly focusing on promoting health and wellbeing is the key to the future. Success requires political support, technical and<br>
administrative innovation and changes in how financial resources and other<br>
assets are deployed.<br>
The framework for Europe is closely aligned to WHO’s Twelfth General<br>
Programme of Work and is a practical expression of a programme of reform<br>
in WHO that seeks to enable the Organization to respond to Member State<br>
needs more effectively in a rapidly changing world. In the European Region,<br>
as in other regions, the outcomes envisaged in this policy framework require<br>
that international organizations be able to work not just with selected sectoral<br>
ministries but across all relevant parts of government; with colleagues in other<br>
international organizations that influence health; as well as with industry,<br>
academe and civil society. The policy framework for Europe signals the way<br>
forward for new approaches to health and well-being worldwide.<br>

Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Health 2020, the European<br>
health policy framework for all. Whether you are a president, prime minister,<br>
mayor, policy-maker, public health worker or community activist, Health 2020<br>
contains information that can help you make healthier, safer and economically<br>
wiser decisions and choices.<br>
Our 21st century health landscape is shaped by growing global, regional,<br>
national and local interdependence and an increasingly complex array of<br>
interlinking factors that influence health and well-being. We are all challenged,<br>
for example, with the task of making sense of and integrating the many<br>
different actors and sectoral services (such as housing, water, energy, food<br>
and health care) needed to keep ourselves, our families and our populations<br>
healthy and happy. We all know that poor health wastes potential, causes<br>
despair and suffering and drains resources. Addressing these challenges at<br>
any level – personal, institutional, community, municipal or national – requires<br>
thoughtful, strategic and coordinated action. All 53 Member States in the<br>
WHO European Region have developed and adopted Health 2020 as a guiding<br>
framework to support such action.<br>
Health 2020 elaborates a vision of public health as a dynamic network of<br>
stakeholders at all levels of society and aims to support action with unity of<br>
purpose across the Region. All recommendations in Health 2020 are evidenceinformed. Its development has actively involved many experts. Our aim<br>
throughout has been to make Health 2020 a unique compilation of the best<br>
public health policy evidence available.<br>
Building on an extensive review of published evidence, experiential data<br>
and an unprecedented Region-wide participatory stakeholder consultation,<br>
the Health 2020 development process has catalysed a broad rethinking of<br>
current public health mechanisms, processes, relationships and institutional<br>
arrangements. As a consequence of this process, Health 2020 serves as a<br>
unique regional resource to help us all learn from experiences acquired in<br>
practice, reset priorities and identify better ways to coordinate action amongst<br>
stakeholders in all sectors to improve individual and population health and<br>
well-being.<br>
Health 2020 acknowledges and celebrates the wide diversity of health systems<br>
and approaches across the European Region. It aims not to make national and<br>
local health systems uniform but to make them uniformly better. In adopting<br>
Health 2020, all countries agreed on two common objectives: the need to<br>
improve health for all and reduce the health divide and the need to strengthen<br>
leadership and participatory governance for health.<br>
In outlining ways to address these objectives, Health 2020 proposes new<br>
forms of governance for health, in which health and well-being are seen as<br>
the responsibility of the whole of society and of the whole of government, and<br>
encourages active public participation in policy-making.<br>
It addresses the socioeconomic rationale for improving health and makes a<br>
strong, evidence-informed case for investment and action through integrated<br>
approaches to health promotion, disease prevention and well-being. Actions<br>
on social determinants are described that address the development<br>
Foreword<br>

Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
of approaches that build health into all policies with the aim of improving<br>
the health of everyone and thereby reduce the absolute effect of social<br>
determinants on all people as well as targeted interventions that focus on<br>
those most affected.<br>
Health 2020 identifies new systems of collaborative leadership to encourage<br>
innovative approaches to social mobilization for equitable, sustainable and<br>
accountable health development.<br>
Health 2020 details a variety of innovative and effective ways to address<br>
today’s complex public health challenges. It outlines a variety of strategies and<br>
interventions to address major health challenges across the lifespan related to<br>
both noncommunicable and infectious diseases. It shows ways to link clinical<br>
interventions with action on equity and social determinants of health and<br>
necessary key health system inputs such as human resources and medicines<br>
in higher quality, strengthening health funding arrangements and enhancing<br>
governance for health.<br>
By articulating a common set of values, evidence and experience, Health<br>
2020 provides a platform for partnership and cooperation. It calls for crosssociety engagement as a central part of health policy planning, development,<br>
implementation and monitoring at all levels. It makes the case for empowering<br>
people, citizens, consumers and patients as a critical factor in improving health<br>
outcomes. It argues strongly for the engagement of health professionals.<br>
What will WHO do to help? The Regional Office will support countries in<br>
adapting Health 2020 by analysing public health situations; identifying assets;<br>
encouraging political commitment from presidents and prime ministers;<br>
making policy recommendations and monitoring progress; encouraging<br>
leadership and good governance for health; suggesting mechanisms for<br>
whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches; and supporting<br>
capacity development.<br>
Two key Health 2020 support documents have been developed. The European<br>
policy framework for supporting government and society for health and wellbeing provides politicians, policy- and decision-makers and practitioners<br>
with the main values and action principles needed for putting a Health<br>
2020 approach into practice in their settings. The longer Health 2020 policy<br>
framework and strategy provides more detail in terms of evidence and is<br>
meant for those who practice policy development and implementation at<br>
operational levels.<br>
I believe Health 2020 can add significant value to all of our individual and<br>
collective work to enhance health and well-being, serve as unique resource to<br>
enhance the future and prosperity of individual countries and the Region as<br>
a whole and benefit all its peoples. Actively informing and aligning our daily<br>
practice with Health 2020 values and approaches will enable us to build a<br>
healthier Europe for ourselves and our children.<br>

Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
Health is a major societal resource and<br>
asset<br>
Good health benefits all sectors and the whole of society – making<br>
it a valuable resource. Good health is essential for economic and social<br>
development and a vital concern to the lives of every single person, all<br>
families and communities. Poor health wastes potential, causes despair<br>
and drains resources across all sectors. Enabling people to have control<br>
over their health and its determinants strengthens communities and<br>
improves lives. Without people’s active involvement, many opportunities<br>
to promote and protect their health and increase their well-being are<br>
lost.<br>
What makes societies prosper and flourish also makes people<br>
healthy – policies that recognize this have more impact. Fair access<br>
to education, decent work, housing and income all support health.<br>
Health contributes to increased productivity, a more efficient workforce,<br>
healthier ageing, and less expenditure on sickness and social benefits<br>
and fewer lost tax revenues. The health and well-being of the population<br>
are best achieved if the whole of government works together to address<br>
the social and individual determinants of health. Good health can<br>
support economic recovery and development.<br>
Health performance and economic performance are interlinked –<br>
improving the health sector’s use of its resources is essential. The<br>
health sector is important for both its direct and indirect effects on<br>
the economy: it matters not only because of how it affects people’s<br>
health and their productivity but because it is now one of the largest<br>
economic sectors in every medium- and high-income country. It is a<br>
major employer, important landowner, builder and consumer. It is also<br>
a major driver of research and innovation and a significant sector in the<br>
international competition for people, ideas and products. Its importance<br>
will continue to grow and, with it, the significance of its contribution to<br>
wider societal goals.<br>
Across the WHO European Region as a whole, health has greatly<br>
improved in recent decades – but not everywhere and not for<br>
“The enjoyment of the highest<br>
attainable standard of health is<br>
one of the fundamental rights of<br>
every human being.”<br>
WHO Constitution<br>
Dear Prime Minister, Minister,<br>
Mayor or Member of<br>
Parliament,<br>
Good health underpins social<br>
and economic development and<br>
strengthens policies across all<br>
sectors. However, the economic<br>
and fiscal crisis facing many<br>
countries presents serious<br>
challenges and potentially<br>
risks undermining the positive<br>
progress that has been made.<br>
Nevertheless, it also presents<br>
an important opportunity to<br>
refocus and renew our efforts to<br>
improve the health of all people.<br>
All sectors and levels of<br>
government contribute to health<br>
creation. Your leadership for<br>
health and well-being can<br>
make a tremendous difference<br>
for the people of your country,<br>
state, region or city and for the<br>
European Region as a whole.<br>
Your support for Health 2020 is<br>
truly essential.<br>
“We want to see better health<br>
and well-being for all, as an<br>
equal human right. Money does<br>
not buy better health. Good<br>
policies that promote equity<br>
have a better chance. We must<br>
tackle the root causes (of ill<br>
health and inequities) through<br>
a social determinants approach<br>
that engages the whole of<br>
government and the whole of<br>
society.”<br>
Margaret Chan,<br>
WHO Director-General<br>
The 53 Member States in the WHO European Region have agreed on a<br>
new common policy framework – Health 2020. Their shared goals are<br>
to “significantly improve the health and well-being of populations,<br>
reduce health inequalities, strengthen public health and ensure<br>
people-centred health systems that are universal, equitable,<br>
sustainable and of high quality”.<br>
Health 2020 recognizes the diversity of countries across the<br>
Region. It reaches out to many different people, within and outside<br>
of government, to provide inspiration and direction on how better<br>
to address the complex health challenges of the 21st century. The<br>
framework confirms the values of Health for All and – supported by the<br>
evidence provided in the accompanying documents – identifies two key<br>
strategic directions with four policy priority action areas. It builds on the<br>
experiences gained from previous Health for All policies to guide both<br>
Member States and the WHO Regional Office for Europe.<br>

Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
Rio Political Declaration<br>
on Social Determinants of<br>
Health (2011)<br>
What is a social gradient?<br>
Investing in health<br>
makes sense<br>
“Health inequities arise from the<br>
societal conditions in which people<br>
are born, grow, live, work and age,<br>
referred to as social determinants of<br>
health.”<br>
The participants declared:<br>
“We reaffirm that health inequities<br>
within and between countries<br>
are politically, socially and<br>
economically unacceptable, as well<br>
as unfair and largely avoidable,<br>
and that the promotion of health<br>
equity is essential to sustainable<br>
development and to a better quality<br>
of life and well-being for all, which<br>
in turn can contribute to peace and<br>
security.”<br>
The social gradient in health means<br>
that health gets progressively better<br>
as the socioeconomic position<br>
of people and/or communities<br>
improve. Thus health inequities<br>
affect everyone. This is a global<br>
phenomenon that applies to all<br>
countries, irrespective of income.<br>
Of the increase in health spending,<br>
92% correlates with positive growth<br>
in gross domestic product (GDP).<br>
During the last three decades,<br>
health system spending in most<br>
countries in the Organisation<br>
for Economic Co-operation and<br>
Development (OECD) has begun<br>
to rise – on average at least 1% per<br>
year faster than real GDP across the<br>
OECD. In 1950, health spending in<br>
the United Kingdom was 3% of GDP.<br>
Even in the United States in 1970,<br>
health spending was only 7% of<br>
GDP. The average health spending<br>
in the OECD rose from 5% of GDP in<br>
1970 to 9% in 2010.<br>
A strong value base: reaching<br>
the highest attainable standard<br>
of health<br>
A strong social and economic<br>
case for improving health<br>
everyone equally; this is unacceptable. Many groups and areas have<br>
been left behind and, in many instances, as economies falter, health<br>
inequalities are growing within and between countries. Ethnic minorities,<br>
some migrant communities and groups such as Travellers and Roma<br>
suffer disproportionately. Shifting patterns of disease, demography<br>
and migration may affect progress in health and require improved<br>
management and governance. Rapid growth of chronic disease and<br>
mental disorders, lack of social cohesion, environmental threats and<br>
financial uncertainties make improving health even more difficult and<br>
threaten the sustainability of health and welfare systems. Creative and<br>
innovative responses, to which there is real commitment, are needed.<br>
Health 2020 is based on the values enshrined in the WHO Constitution:<br>
“The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the<br>
fundamental rights of every human being”. Countries across the WHO<br>
European Region have acknowledged the right to health and committed<br>
themselves to universality, solidarity and equal access as the guiding<br>
values for organizing and funding their health systems. They aim for the<br>
highest attainable level of health regardless of ethnicity, sex, age, social<br>
status or ability to pay. These values include fairness, sustainability, quality,<br>
transparency, accountability, gender equality, dignity and the right to<br>
participate in decision-making.<br>
The challenge health expenditure poses to governments is greater<br>
than ever. In many countries, the health share of government budgets<br>
is larger than ever, and health care costs have grown faster than GDP.<br>
But for at least some of these countries, data show a lack of correlation<br>
between health expenditure and health outcome. Many health systems<br>
fail to contain costs while financial pressures on them make getting the<br>
balance right for health and ensuring social protection ever harder. Costs<br>
are primarily driven by the supply side, such as new treatments and<br>
technologies, and people’s rising expectations of protection from health<br>
risks and access to high-quality health care. Before being embarked on,<br>
any health reform should give careful consideration to deeply entrenched<br>
economic and political interests and social and cultural opposition. These<br>
challenges require intersectoral approaches, since health ministers cannot<br>
resolve them on their own.<br>
Real health benefits can be attained at an affordable cost and within<br>
resource constraints if effective strategies are adopted. A growing<br>
body of evidence on the economics of disease prevention shows how<br>
health costs can be contained, but only if they also address inequalities<br>
across the social gradient and support the most vulnerable people. At<br>
present, governments spend only a small fraction of their health budgets<br>
on promoting health and preventing disease – about 3% in OECD<br>
countries – and many do not systematically address inequalities. Social<br>
12<br>
Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
and technological advances, if used effectively, offer real health benefits,<br>
especially in the areas of information, social marketing and social media.<br>
Using resources efficiently within the health sector can contain costs.<br>
European health systems are being required to improve their performance<br>
and respond to new challenges. Reconfiguring services, acquiring new<br>
responsibilities, introducing incentives and payment structures can<br>
provide better value for money. Health systems, like other sectors, need<br>
to adapt and change. Health policy statements by such organizations as<br>
the European Union (EU) and the OECD have reinforced this.<br>
In a globalized world, countries are increasingly required to<br>
work together to solve many key health challenges. This requires<br>
cooperation across borders. Many international agreements underline<br>
this requirement, such as the International Health Regulations, the WHO<br>
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control or the Doha Declaration on<br>
the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (related to intellectual property).<br>
Health 2020 recognizes that successful governments can achieve real<br>
improvements in health if they work across government to fulfil two<br>
linked strategic objectives:<br>
•	 improving health for all and reducing health inequalities<br>
•	 improving leadership and participatory governance for health.<br>
Countries, regions and cities setting common objectives and joint<br>
investment between health and other sectors can significantly<br>
improve health and well-being. Priority areas include: preschool<br>
education, educational performance, employment and working<br>
conditions, social protection and reducing poverty. Approaches include:<br>
addressing community resilience, social inclusion and cohesion;<br>
promoting assets for well-being; mainstreaming gender and building<br>
the individual and community strengths that protect and promote<br>
health, such as individual skills and a sense of belonging. Setting targets<br>
for reducing health inequalities can help drive action and is one of the<br>
principal ways of assessing health development at all levels.<br>
Addressing social inequalities contributes significantly to health and<br>
well-being. The causes are complex and deeply rooted across the life<br>
course, reinforcing disadvantage and vulnerability. Health 2020 highlights<br>
the increasing concern about tackling poor health within countries and<br>
across the Region as a whole. The lowest and highest life expectancies<br>
at birth in the WHO European Region differ by 16 years, with differences<br>
between the life expectancies of men and women; and maternal mortality<br>
rates are up to 43 times higher in some countries in the Region than in<br>
others. Such extreme health inequalities are also linked to health-related<br>
Strategic objectives of Health<br>
2020: stronger equity and better<br>
governance for health<br>
Improving health for all and<br>
reducing health inequalities<br>
Prevention works …<br>
… for all sectors …<br>
… but must be targeted to<br>
reduce health inequalities<br>
Adapted from: Dahlgren G, Whitehead M.<br>
Tackling inequalities in health: what can<br>
we learn from what has been tried?<br>
London, King’s Fund, 1993.<br>
For example, evidence from Poland<br>
shows that changes in diet and<br>
smoking reduce chronic heart<br>
disease and overall premature<br>
mortality rates.<br>
The most cost-effective tobacco<br>
control policy is raising taxes. A<br>
10% price increase could result<br>
in 0.6 million to 1.8 million fewer<br>
premature deaths in the countries in<br>
eastern Europe and central Asia.<br>
The tangible benefits of increasing<br>
taxes on alcohol in England were<br>
estimated to include reductions of<br>
€183 million in health and welfare<br>
costs and €405 million in labour and<br>
productivity losses, and the cost of<br>
implementation was less than €0.10<br>
per person (€3.7 million total).<br>
The savings to the health service<br>
from reduced hospital admissions<br>
related to alcohol were an estimated<br>
€65 million in the first year, and €118<br>
million of crime-related costs were<br>
saved.<br>
In countries such as the Russian<br>
Federation, a comprehensive<br>
prevention package would cost no<br>
more than US$ 4 per person per year.<br>
There are important inequalities<br>
within countries across key lifestyle<br>
indicators, including: smoking rates,<br>
obesity, exercise and limiting longterm illness.<br>
In addition, the 20% of the population<br>
with the lowest income is most likely<br>
to delay seeking care because of fear<br>
of financial catastrophe from out-ofpocket payments.<br>

Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
14<br>
Leadership from health ministers and public health agencies will<br>
remain vitally important to address the disease burden across the<br>
European Region. It needs to be strengthened. The health sector is<br>
responsible for: developing and implementing national and subnational<br>
health strategies; setting health goals and targets for improving health;<br>
assessing how the policies of other sectors affect health; delivering highquality and effective health care services; and ensuring core public health<br>
functions. It also has to consider how its health policy decisions affect<br>
other sectors and stakeholders.<br>
Health ministries and public health agencies are increasingly engaged<br>
in initiating intersectoral approaches for health and acting as health<br>
brokers and advocates. This includes highlighting both the economic,<br>
social and political benefits of good health and the adverse effects of ill<br>
health and inequalities on every sector, the whole of government and<br>
the whole of society. Exercising such a leadership role requires using<br>
diplomacy, evidence, argument and persuasion. The health sector also<br>
has a partnership role towards other sectors when strengthening health<br>
can contribute to achieving their goals. All countries at the United Nations<br>
High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable<br>
Diseases and the World Health Assembly have endorsed such collaborative<br>
approaches – referred to as whole-of-government and whole-of-society<br>
approaches.<br>
Governments at all levels are considering establishing formal<br>
structures and processes that support coherence and intersectoral<br>
problem-solving. This can strengthen coordination and address power<br>
imbalances between sectors. The strategic benefits of adopting a health<br>
in all policies approach are increasingly being recognized. This approach<br>
advocates moving health up the policy agenda, strengthening policy<br>
dialogue on health and its determinants, and building accountability for<br>
health outcomes. Health impact assessment and economic evaluation are<br>
valuable tools in assessing the potential effects of policies and can also<br>
be used to assess how policies affect equity. Qualitative and quantitative<br>
health data can be gathered and validated to assess impact on health.<br>
Improving leadership and<br>
participatory governance for<br>
health<br>
behaviour, including tobacco and alcohol use, diet and physical activity<br>
and mental disorders, which in turn reflect the stress and disadvantage in<br>
people’s lives.<br>
Taking action on the social and environmental determinants of<br>
health can address many inequalities effectively. Research shows<br>
that effective interventions require a policy environment that overcomes<br>
sectoral boundaries and enables integrated programmes. For example,<br>
evidence clearly indicates that integrated approaches to child well-being<br>
and early childhood development produce better and fairer outcomes<br>
in both health and education. Urban development that considers the<br>
determinants of health is crucial, and mayors and local authorities<br>
play an ever more important role in promoting health and well-being.<br>
Participation, accountability and sustainable funding mechanisms<br>
reinforce the effects of such local programmes.<br>
Education and health<br>
together<br>
Whole-of-government<br>
approach<br>
Health in all policies<br>
Considerable evidence supports the<br>
claim that education and health are<br>
correlated. Data indicate that the<br>
number of years of formal schooling<br>
completed is the most important<br>
correlate of good health.<br>
According to the 2003 Human<br>
development report (United Nations<br>
Development Programme):<br>
“Education, health, nutrition and<br>
water and sanitation complement<br>
each other, with investments in<br>
any one contributing to better<br>
outcomes in the others”.<br>
Whole-of-government activities<br>
are multilevel (from local to<br>
global) government actions, also<br>
increasingly involving groups<br>
outside government. This approach<br>
requires building trust, common<br>
ethics, a cohesive culture and new<br>
skills. It stresses the need for better<br>
coordination and integration,<br>
centred on the overall societal goals<br>
for which the government stands.<br>
In countries with federal systems<br>
or in which the regional and local<br>
levels are politically autonomous,<br>
extensive consultations across<br>
levels of government can<br>
strengthen whole-of-government<br>
approaches.<br>
Accountability is required at all<br>
levels and in all systems.<br>
Health in all policies is designed<br>
to make governance for health<br>
and well-being a priority for more<br>
than the health sector. It works<br>
in both directions, ensuring that<br>
all sectors understand and act on<br>
their responsibility for health while<br>
recognizing how health affects<br>
other sectors.<br>
Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
15<br>
Research in well-being – as conducted in other organizations such as the<br>
OECD – can also contribute.<br>
Governments are also committed to establishing structures and<br>
processes that enable increased involvement of a wider range of<br>
stakeholders. This is especially important for citizens, civil society<br>
organizations and other groups (such as migrants) that make up civil<br>
society. Active and committed groups are increasingly coming together<br>
to advance health at all levels of governance. Examples range from global<br>
to local levels and include: United Nations summits deliberating health;<br>
the Inter-Parliamentary Union; the WHO Healthy Cities and Communities<br>
movement; global movements to fight poverty; disease-specific advocacy<br>
such as HIV; national initiatives to define health targets; and the regional<br>
health strategies of entities such as the EU. They play a significant role in<br>
promoting health and advancing the health agenda.<br>
Effective leadership throughout society can support better results<br>
for health. Research shows strong correlations between responsible<br>
governance, new forms of leadership and participation. In the 21st<br>
century, many individuals, sectors and organizations can provide<br>
leadership for health. This can take many forms and requires creativity and<br>
new skills, especially in managing conflicts of interest and finding new<br>
ways of tackling intractable complex problems. Together with Member<br>
States, WHO has a special responsibility to exercise such leadership and to<br>
support health ministries in achieving their goals.<br>
Empowering people, citizens, consumers and patients is critical for<br>
improving health outcomes, health system performance and patient<br>
satisfaction. The voice of civil society, including individuals and patient<br>
organizations, youth organizations and senior citizens is essential to draw<br>
attention to health-damaging environments, lifestyles or products and<br>
to gaps in the quality and provision of health care. It is also critical for<br>
generating new ideas.<br>
Working together on common<br>
policy priorities for health<br>
The Health 2020 policy is based on four priority areas for policy action:<br>
•	 investing in health through a life-course approach and empowering<br>
people;<br>
•	 tackling the Region’s major health challenges of noncommunicable<br>
and communicable diseases;<br>
•	 strengthening people-centred health systems, public health capacity<br>
and emergency preparedness, surveillance and response; and<br>
•	 creating resilient communities and supportive environments.<br>
In a spirit of coherence and consistency, the four priority areas build<br>
on the “categories for priority-setting and programmes in WHO”.<br>
Those categories were agreed by Member States at the global level and<br>
have been aligned to address the special requirements and experiences<br>
of the European Region. They also build on relevant WHO strategies and<br>
action plans at regional and global levels.<br>
The four priority areas are interlinked, interdependent and mutually<br>
supportive. For example, action on the life course and empowerment of<br>
Whole-of-society approach<br>
Contribution of civil society<br>
A whole-of-society approach goes<br>
beyond institutions: it influences<br>
and mobilizes local and global<br>
culture and media, rural and urban<br>
communities and all relevant policy<br>
sectors, such as the education<br>
system, the transport sector, the<br>
environment and even urban<br>
design, as demonstrated in the<br>
case of obesity and the global food<br>
system.<br>
Whole-of-society approaches are a<br>
form of collaborative governance<br>
that can complement public policy.<br>
They emphasize coordination<br>
through normative values and<br>
trust-building among a wide variety<br>
of actors.<br>
By engaging the private sector,<br>
civil society, communities and<br>
individuals, the whole-of-society<br>
approach can strengthen the<br>
resilience of communities to<br>
withstand threats to their health,<br>
security and well-being.<br>
Civil society is a key actor in<br>
formulating, promoting and<br>
delivering change. The WHO<br>
European Region has been at the<br>
forefront of forming innovative<br>
partnerships with civil society,<br>
including with communities of key<br>
population groups at higher risk<br>
(such as with people living with<br>
HIV) and with nongovernmental<br>
organizations that advocate for<br>
and provide services. Several<br>
pan-European networks and<br>
organizations have emerged, as the<br>
number of people living with HIV<br>
has increased.<br>
Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
16<br>
people will help contain the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases, as<br>
will stronger public health capacity. These, in turn, will also help to contain<br>
communicable disease outbreaks. Governments achieve higher health<br>
impact when they link up policies, investments and services and focus on<br>
reducing inequalities. The WHO Regional Office for Europe will step up its<br>
role as a resource for developing policy based on evidence and examples<br>
of integrated approaches. Regional headline targets will support the<br>
monitoring of Health 2020’s progress.<br>
Addressing the four priorities requires a combination of governance<br>
approaches that promote health, equity and well-being. Smart<br>
governance will anticipate change, foster innovation and be oriented<br>
towards investing in promoting health and preventing disease.<br>
Approaches to governance will include governing through public policy<br>
and regulation as well as new forms of collaboration with civil society<br>
organizations, independent agencies and expert bodies. There is an<br>
increasing need to apply evidence to policy and practice, observe ethical<br>
boundaries, expand transparency, and strengthen accountability in such<br>
fields as privacy, risk assessment and health impact assessment.<br>
Health 2020 recognizes that countries engage from different startingpoints and have different contexts and capacity. Many health policy<br>
decisions have to be taken under conditions of uncertain and imperfect<br>
knowledge, and the wider system effects of many aspects of reforming<br>
health systems also cannot be fully predicted. Tackling complex problems<br>
such as obesity, multimorbidity and neurodegenerative diseases is<br>
challenging. Drawing on knowledge from the social, behavioural and<br>
policy sciences is proving increasingly important, including social<br>
marketing, behavioural economics and neuroscience. Studies note the<br>
value of promoting smaller-scale yet comprehensive interventions at<br>
the local and community levels, to encourage learning and adaptation.<br>
Cooperation across the European Region can accelerate the development<br>
of expertise: every country and sector can both learn and contribute.<br>
Priority area 1. Investing in health<br>
through a life-course approach and<br>
empowering people<br>
Supporting good health throughout the life-course leads to<br>
increasing healthy life expectancy and a longevity dividend, both of<br>
which can yield important economic, societal and individual benefits.<br>
The demographic transformation underway in countries requires an<br>
effective life-course strategy that gives priority to new approaches to<br>
promoting health and preventing disease. Improving health and health<br>
equity begins with pregnancy and early child development. Healthy<br>
children learn better, healthy adults are more productive, and healthy<br>
older people can continue to contribute actively to society. Healthy and<br>
active ageing, is a policy priority and a major research priority.<br>
Health promotion programmes based on principles of engagement<br>
and empowerment offer real benefits. These include: creating better<br>
conditions for health, improving health literacy, supporting independent<br>
living and making the healthier choice the easier choice. Furthermore,<br>
it means making pregnancies safe; giving people a healthy start in life;<br>
promoting safety and well-being and giving protection during childhood<br>
Health 2020 headline<br>
targets<br>
Health information<br>
systems support the Health<br>
2020 process<br>
Health 2020 strives to achieve<br>
measurable impact on health in the<br>
Region. The regional goals below<br>
have been agreed by Member<br>
States.<br>
1. Reduce premature mortality in<br>
the European Region by 2020.<br>
2. Increase life expectancy in the<br>
European Region.<br>
3. Reduce inequalities in health in<br>
the European Region.<br>
4. Enhance the well-being of the<br>
European Region population.<br>
5. Ensure universal coverage<br>
and the right to the highest<br>
attainable level of health.<br>
6. Set national goals and targets<br>
related to health in Member<br>
States.<br>
A set of voluntary indicators agreed<br>
on by Member States can support<br>
national goals and targets related<br>
to health.<br>
Health information systems and<br>
services need to be developed<br>
across the Member States of<br>
the WHO European Region. The<br>
WHO Regional Office for Europe<br>
works to assist Member States in<br>
their assessment and technical<br>
improvement, and provides health<br>
information to Member States by:<br>
•	 working with international<br>
partners to ensure the<br>
standardization, international<br>
comparability and quality of<br>
health data;<br>
•	 working with a network of health<br>
agencies dealing with health<br>
information and evidence; and<br>
•	 actively compiling,<br>
disseminating and granting<br>
easy access to health data and<br>
research evidence.<br>
Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
17<br>
Health 2020 focuses on a set of effective integrated strategies and<br>
interventions to address major health challenges across the Region.<br>
These are related to both noncommunicable and communicable diseases.<br>
Both types require combining determined public health action and health<br>
care system interventions. The effectiveness of these is underpinned<br>
by actions on equity, social determinants of health, empowerment and<br>
supportive environments.<br>
A combination of approaches is required to successfully address the<br>
high burden of noncommunicable diseases in the Region. Health<br>
2020 supports the implementation of integrated whole-of-government<br>
and whole-of-society approaches that have been agreed in other regional<br>
and global strategies, since it is increasingly recognized that action to<br>
influence individual behaviour has limited impact. Noncommunicable<br>
diseases are unequally distributed within and between countries and are<br>
closely linked to action on the social and environmental determinants of<br>
health.<br>
Priority area 2. Tackling Europe’s major<br>
health challenges: noncommunicable<br>
and communicable diseases<br>
and for young people; promoting healthy workplaces; and supporting<br>
healthy ageing. Providing healthy food and nutrition throughout the<br>
lifespan is a priority given the obesity epidemic that is spreading across<br>
Europe.<br>
Strong evidence indicates that cost-effective policy pathways<br>
can directly enhance population health and well-being. Practical<br>
experience and evidence on health promotion programmes and national<br>
strategies for key disease groups – such as cardiovascular disease or<br>
diabetes – have grown throughout the European Region. They demonstrate<br>
that combining government leadership, supportive environments and<br>
approaches that promote a sense of control and empowerment can<br>
lead to success. Strengthening social behavioural research can provide a<br>
growing evidence base to underpin such developments.<br>
Strengthening mental health promotion programmes is highly<br>
relevant. One in four people in the European Region experience some<br>
type of mental health problem during their lives. A particular challenge<br>
is to promote the early diagnosis of depression and prevent suicide by<br>
initiating community-based intervention programmes. Research is<br>
leading to a better understanding of the damaging association between<br>
mental health problems and social marginalization, unemployment,<br>
homelessness and alcohol and other substance use disorders. New forms<br>
of addiction related to online virtual worlds must also be addressed.<br>
A strategic focus on healthy living for both young and older people<br>
is particularly valuable. A broad range of stakeholders can contribute<br>
to programmes that support their health, including intergenerational<br>
activities. For young people, these can include peer-to-peer education,<br>
involvement of youth organizations and school-based health literacy<br>
programmes. Integrating work on mental and sexual health is particularly<br>
important. For older people, active and healthy ageing initiatives can<br>
benefit health and quality of life.<br>
Governance for health<br>
usually requires a mix of<br>
strategies<br>
The Moscow Declaration on Healthy<br>
Lifestyles and Noncommunicable<br>
Disease Control (2011) states:<br>
“We … recognize that a paradigm<br>
shift is imperative in dealing with<br>
NCD challenges, as NCDs are<br>
not only caused by biomedical<br>
factors but also caused or strongly<br>
influenced by behavioural,<br>
environmental, social and economic<br>
factors.”<br>
Evidence-informed and costeffective strategies for reducing<br>
tobacco use have been identified,<br>
comprising the WHO Framework<br>
Convention on Tobacco Control and<br>
six MPOWER strategies supporting<br>
the Convention at the country level:<br>
1. monitoring tobacco<br>
consumption and the<br>
effectiveness of preventive<br>
measures;<br>
2. protecting people from<br>
exposure to tobacco smoke;<br>
3. offering assistance for<br>
smoking cessation;<br>
4. warning about the dangers<br>
of tobacco;<br>
5. enforcing restrictions<br>
on tobacco advertising,<br>
promotion and sponsorship;<br>
and<br>
6. raising taxes on tobacco.<br>
Tobacco control interventions are<br>
the second most effective way to<br>
spend funds to improve health,<br>
after childhood immunization.<br>
Similar evidence-informed<br>
strategies need to be developed<br>
for other systemic health risks, such<br>
as obesity. For alcohol, Member<br>
States have already adopted a global<br>
policy and a regional policy.<br>
Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
18<br>
Health 2020 supports intensifying efforts to implement global and<br>
regional mandates in relation to noncommunicable diseases. The<br>
priority action areas for the Region include the following.<br>
•	 Existing declarations and strategies. These include: the United<br>
Nations 2011 political declaration on noncommunicable diseases; the<br>
WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; the Global Strategy<br>
on Diet, Physical Activity and Health; the global strategy to reduce the<br>
harmful use of alcohol and regional action plan to reduce the harmful<br>
use of alcohol; the action plan for the implementation of the European<br>
Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases<br>
2012–2016; and the WHO Mental Health Action Plan for Europe.<br>
•	 Health promotion. As defined in the Ottawa Charter for Health<br>
Promotion, this is at the core of these declarations and strategies.<br>
They all encourage governments to develop intersectoral national<br>
strategies with goals and targets on key challenges related to<br>
noncommunicable diseases.<br>
Health 2020 supports continued strong efforts to combat<br>
communicable diseases. No country can afford to relax its vigilance, and<br>
each has to continually strive to maintain the highest standards. For the<br>
European Region, the priority action areas are as follows.<br>
•	 Building information and surveillance capacity: to implement the<br>
International Health Regulations, improve information exchange and,<br>
where appropriate, implement joint surveillance and disease control<br>
activities by public health, veterinary, food and agriculture authorities<br>
to better control infectious diseases that can be transmitted from<br>
animals to humans, including emerging infectious diseases, drugresistant organisms and waterborne and foodborne infections.<br>
•	 Tackling serious viral and bacterial threats: to implement regional<br>
policies and action plans; to combat antimicrobial resistance; to<br>
contain the emergence and spread of drug-resistant organisms<br>
and infections through the prudent use of antibiotics and infection<br>
control; to ensure safe basic commodities such as water and food;<br>
to reach and maintain recommended immunization coverage to<br>
prevent vaccine-preventable diseases; and to reach regional and<br>
global eradication and elimination goals for polio, measles, rubella<br>
and malaria; to fully control major diseases such as tuberculosis,<br>
HIV and influenza by ensuring that the whole population, including<br>
vulnerable groups, has access to the health care system and evidenceinformed interventions.<br>
Priority area 3. Strengthening peoplecentred health systems, public health<br>
capacity and emergency preparedness,<br>
surveillance and response<br>
Achieving high-quality care and improved health outcomes requires<br>
health systems that are financially viable, fit for purpose, peoplecentred and evidence-informed. All countries have to adapt to changing<br>
demography and patterns of disease, especially mental health challenges,<br>
chronic diseases and conditions related to ageing. This requires reorienting<br>
health care systems to give priority to disease prevention, foster continual<br>
Burden of<br>
noncommunicable<br>
diseases<br>
Burden of mental disorders<br>
Burden of tuberculosis<br>
The European Region has the highest<br>
burden of noncommunicable<br>
diseases worldwide. Two disease<br>
groups, cardiovascular diseases and<br>
cancer, cause almost three quarters<br>
of mortality in the Region, and three<br>
main disease groups, cardiovascular<br>
diseases, cancer and mental<br>
disorders, cause more than half<br>
the burden of disease (measured<br>
using disability-adjusted life-years<br>
(DALYs)). Much premature mortality<br>
is avoidable: estimates indicate that<br>
at least 80% of all heart disease,<br>
stroke and type 2 diabetes and<br>
at least one third of cancer cases<br>
are preventable. Inequality in the<br>
burden of noncommunicable<br>
diseases within and between<br>
countries demonstrates that the<br>
potential for health gain is still<br>
enormous.<br>
Mental disorders are the second<br>
largest contributor to the burden<br>
of disease (measured using DALYs)<br>
in the European Region (at 19%)<br>
and the most important cause of<br>
disability. The ageing population<br>
leads to an increase of the<br>
prevalence of dementia. Common<br>
mental disorders (depression and<br>
anxiety) affect about 1 in 4 people<br>
in the community every year.<br>
However, about 50% of people with<br>
mental disorders do not receive<br>
any form of treatment. Stigma and<br>
discrimination are major reasons<br>
why people avoid seeking help.<br>
In 2010, the European Region<br>
had an estimated 420 000 new<br>
and relapsed tuberculosis (TB)<br>
cases and 61 000 deaths caused<br>
by TB. Most TB, 87% of new cases<br>
and 94% of deaths, occurs in the<br>
eastern and central parts of the<br>
Region. The Region has the lowest<br>
treatment success rate globally,<br>
reflecting the high rate of TB drug<br>
resistance; multidrug-resistant TB<br>
is found in 13% of newly treated<br>
cases and 42% of those previously<br>
treated. The disease is often linked<br>
to poor socioeconomic conditions<br>
and other determinants, including<br>
homelessness.<br>

quality improvement and integrate service delivery, ensure continuity of<br>
care, support self-care by patients and relocate care as close to home as is<br>
safe and cost-effective. The potential of personalized medicine needs to<br>
be assessed.<br>
Health 2020 reconfirms the commitment of WHO and its Member<br>
States to ensure universal coverage, including access to high-quality<br>
and affordable care and medicines. Many countries have achieved<br>
universal coverage but much needs to be done to eliminate catastrophic<br>
and impoverishing payments in the Region. It is important to ensure longterm sustainability and resilience to economic cycles, to contain supplydriven cost increases and to eliminate wasteful spending while providing<br>
reasonable levels of financial protection. Health technology assessment<br>
and quality assurance mechanisms are especially important for health<br>
system transparency and accountability and are an integral part of a<br>
patient safety culture.<br>
Health 2020 remains committed to a primary health care approach<br>
as a cornerstone of health systems in the 21st century. Primary health<br>
care can respond to today’s needs by fostering an enabling environment<br>
for partnerships to thrive, and encouraging people to participate in new<br>
ways in their treatment and take better care of their own health. Making<br>
full use of 21st-century tools and innovations such as communications<br>
technology – digital records, telemedicine and e-health – and social<br>
media can contribute to better and more cost-effective care. Recognizing<br>
patients as a resource and as partners, and being accountable for patient<br>
outcome are important principles.<br>
Achieving better health outcomes requires substantially<br>
strengthening public health functions and capacity. Although<br>
public health capacity and resources vary across the Region, prioritizing<br>
investment in public health institutional arrangements and capacitybuilding, and efforts to strengthen health protection, health promotion<br>
and disease prevention can have important cost-effective benefits.<br>
Reviewing and adapting public health laws and instruments to modernize<br>
and strengthen public health functions can also help. Cooperation on<br>
global health and health challenges of a cross-border nature is increasingly<br>
important, as is coordination within countries that have devolved and<br>
decentralized public health responsibilities.<br>
Revitalizing public health and transforming service delivery requires<br>
reforming the education and training of health professionals. A<br>
more flexible, multi-skilled and team-oriented workforce is at the heart<br>
of a health system fit for the 21st century. This includes: team-based<br>
delivery of care; new forms of service delivery (including home care and<br>
long-term care); skills in supporting patient empowerment and self-care;<br>
and enhanced strategic planning, management, working across sectors<br>
and leadership capacity. It implies a new working culture that fosters<br>
new forms of cooperation between professionals in public health and<br>
health care, as well as between health and social services professionals<br>
and health and other sectors. The global health workforce crisis requires<br>
that the WHO Global Code of Practice for the International Recruitment of<br>
Health Personnel be implemented.<br>
Developing adaptive policies, resilient structures and foresight to<br>
effectively anticipate and deal with public health emergencies is<br>
crucial. It is important for policies to reflect the complexities of causal<br>
pathways and respond quickly and innovatively to unpredictable events,<br>
A health system<br>

“Within the political and<br>
institutional framework of each<br>
country, a health system is the<br>
ensemble of all public and private<br>
organizations, institutions and<br>
resources mandated to improve<br>
or restore health. Health systems<br>
encompass both personal and<br>
population services, as well as<br>
activities to influence the policies<br>
and actions of other sectors to<br>
address the social, environmental<br>
and economic determinants of<br>
health.”<br>

Work on the human genome is<br>
substantially changing public<br>

Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
such as in communicable disease outbreaks. The International Health<br>
Regulations require countries to implement a multi-hazard, intersectoral<br>
and cross-border approach to public health emergencies and to be<br>
prepared to effectively manage health-related aspects of emergencies<br>
and humanitarian disasters.<br>
Building resilience is a key factor in protecting and promoting health<br>
and well-being at both the individual and community levels. People’s<br>
health chances are closely linked to the conditions in which they are born,<br>
grow, work and age. Systematically assessing the health effects of a rapidly<br>
changing environment – especially related to technology, work, energy<br>
production and urbanization – is essential and must be followed by action<br>
to ensure positive benefits to health. Resilient communities respond<br>
proactively to new or adverse situations, prepare for economic, social and<br>
environmental change and deal better with crisis and hardship. The WHO<br>
Healthy Cities and Communities movement provides extensive examples<br>
on how to build such resilience, particularly by involving local people and<br>
generating community ownership of health issues. Other settings-based<br>
networks provide similar experiences – such as health-promoting schools<br>
or workplaces.<br>
Collaboration between the environmental and health sectors is<br>
crucial to protect human health from the risks of a hazardous or<br>
contaminated environment and to create health-promoting social and<br>
physical settings. Hazards in the environment are a major determinant<br>
of health; many health conditions are linked to the environment, such<br>
as exposure to air pollution and the impact of climate change, and they<br>
interact with social determinants of health.The benefits to health of a lowcarbon economy and health co-benefits of environmental policies are<br>
being considered in the context of Rio +20, the United Nations Conference<br>
on Sustainable Development. Countries have begun to develop policies<br>
that benefit both the health of the planet and the health of people and<br>
recognize that collaboration between sectors is crucial to protect human<br>
health from the risks of a hazardous or contaminated environment.<br>
Expanding interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration between<br>
human, environmental and animal health enhances public health<br>
effectiveness. This can include: working to fully implement multilateral<br>
environmental agreements as well as the recommendations of the<br>
European environment and health process; expeditiously expanding<br>
the scientific knowledge base; assessing the effects on health of policies<br>
in various sectors, especially those affecting both health and the<br>
environment; ensuring the continual development and adaptation of<br>
services for environment and health; and encouraging the health sector<br>
to act in an environmentally more responsible manner.<br>
Priority area 4. Creating resilient<br>
communities and supportive environments<br>
Working together: adding value through<br>
partnerships<br>
The aims of Health 2020 will be achieved through a combination of<br>
individual and collective efforts. Success requires common purpose<br>
and broad collaborative efforts by people and organizations across<br>
society in every country: governments, nongovernmental organizations,<br>

Europe<br>
The WHO European Region uses<br>
the Acheson definition of public<br>
health: “the science and art of<br>
preventing disease, prolonging<br>
life and promoting health through<br>
the organized efforts of society”.<br>
This is achieved through public<br>
institutions and collective action.<br>
It includes traditional services such<br>
as health situation analysis, health<br>
surveillance, health promotion,<br>
prevention, infectious disease<br>
control, environmental protection<br>
and sanitation, disaster and<br>
health emergency preparedness<br>
and response, and occupational<br>
health, among others. More<br>
recent approaches include social<br>
determinants of health, the social<br>
gradient in health and governance<br>
for health.<br>
In 1989, concerned about the<br>
growing evidence of the impact<br>
of hazardous environments on<br>
human health, countries in the<br>
European Region together with the<br>
WHO Regional Office for Europe<br>
initiated the first ever environment<br>
and health process, to eliminate<br>
the most significant environmental<br>
threats to human health.<br>
Progress towards this goal is<br>
driven by a series of ministerial<br>
conferences held every five years<br>
and coordinated by the WHO<br>
Regional Office for Europe. The<br>
conferences are unique, bringing<br>
together different sectors to shape<br>
policies and actions on environment<br>
and health in the European Region.<br>
Health 2020: a European policy framework<br>
21<br>
civil society, the private sector, science and academe, health professionals,<br>
communities – and every individual.<br>
Key to the success of Health 2020 will be Member States and WHO<br>
working closely together and reaching out to engage other partners.<br>
Close cooperation between the WHO Regional Office for Europe, WHO<br>
headquarters and other regions lies at the core. This is supported by<br>
building wider engagement across regional networks and entities such<br>
as the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian Economic<br>
Community, the countries in south-eastern Europe and the EU.<br>
The WHO Regional Office for Europe will fulfil its constitutional role<br>
to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international<br>
health work in the European Region. It will establish and maintain<br>
effective collaboration with many partners and provide technical<br>
assistance to countries. It will work to engage widely; increase policy<br>
coherence; contribute to shared policy platforms; share health data sets;<br>
join forces for surveillance; and support the development of new types of<br>
network- and web-based cooperation. It will act as the European Region’s<br>
repository of advice and evidence on what works and will work with<br>
countries through new types of country cooperation strategies.<br>
Working with the EU provides a strong fou
